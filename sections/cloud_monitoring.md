## Amazon CloudWatch Metrics

- CloudWatch provides metrics for ***every*** services in AWS
- **Metric** is a variable to monitor (CPUUtilization, NetworkIn, etc..)
- Metrics have **timestamps**
- Can create **CloudWatch dashboards** of metrics

### Example: CloudWatch Billing Metric

**Key Features:**

- Collect and track metrics.
- Set alarms and take automated actions.
- Store and access logs for troubleshooting.

### Important Metrics

- **EC2 Instances:** CPU utilization, Status Checks, Network (not RAM).
  - Default metrics every 5 minutes
  - Option for Detailed Monitoring ($$$): metrics every 1 minute
- **EBS volumes**: Disk Read/Writes
- **S3 Buckets:** BucketSizeBytes, NumberOfObjects, AllRequests
- **Billing**:Total Estimated Charge (only in us-east-1)
- **Service Limits**: how much you have been using a service API
- **RDS Databases:** CPU utilization, free storage space, read/write IOPS
- **Lambda Functions:** Invocation count, error count, duration
- **Custom metrics**: push your own metrics

### Amazon CloudWatch Alarms

- Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric
- Alarms actions…
  - **Auto Scaling:** increase or decrease EC2 instances “desired” count
  - **EC2 Actions:** stop, terminate, reboot or recover an EC2 instance
  - **SNS notifications:** send a notification into an SNS topic
- Various options (sampling, %, max, min, etc...)
- Can choose the period on which to evaluate an alarm
- Example: create **a billing alarm** on the CloudWatch Billing metric
- Alarm States: OK, INSUFFICIENT_DATA, ALARM

## Amazon CloudWatch Logs

- CloudWatch Logs can collect log from:
  - Elastic Beanstalk: collection of logs from application
  - ECS: collection from containers
  - AWS Lambda: collection from function logs
  - CloudTrail based on filter
  - **CloudWatch log agents: on EC2 machines or on-premises servers**
  - Route53: Log DNS queries
- Enables **real-time monitoring** of logs
- Adjustable CloudWatch Logs retention

### CloudWatch Logs for EC2

  ![](../images/CloudWatchLogs_EC2.PNG)

- By default, no logs from your EC2 instance will go to CloudWatch
- You need to run a CloudWatch agent on EC2 to push the log files you want
- Make sure IAM permissions are correct
- **The CloudWatch log agent can be setup on-premises too**

## Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events)

- Delivers a stream of system events describing changes in AWS resources.
- Example: Trigger a Lambda function when an EC2 instance state changes.
- Schedule: Cron jobs (scheduled scripts)
  - Schedule Every hour => Trigger script on Lambda function
- Event Pattern: Event rules to react to a service doing something
  - IAM Root User Sign in Event => SNS Topic with Email Notification
- Trigger Lambda functions, send SQS/SNS messages

### Amazon EventBridge Rules

  ![EVENT BRIDGE RULES](../images/EventBridge_Rules.PNG)

### Amazon EventBridge

  ![EVENT BRIDGE EVENT BUS](../images/Amazon_EventBridge_EventBus.PNG)

- Schema Registry: model event schema
- You can archive events (all/filter) sent to an event bus (indefinitely or set period)
- Ability to replay archived events

## AWS CloudTrail

- Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account
- CloudTrail is enabled by default!
- Get an **history of events / API calls made within your AWS Account** by:
  - Console
  - SDK
  - CLI
  - AWS Services
- Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3
- **A trail can be applied to All Regions (default) or a single Region.**
- If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first!

**Key Features:**

- Logs API calls across AWS services, including CLI, SDK, and Management Console.
- Tracks who made the call, when, and from where.

### CloudTrail Diagram

## AWS X-Ray

- Debugging in Production, the good old way:
  - Test locally
  - Add log statements everywhere
  - Re-deploy in production
- Log formats differ across applications and log analysis is hard.
- Debugging: one big monolith “easy”, distributed services “hard”
- No common views of your entire architecture
- Enter... AWS X-Ray!

### AWS X-Ray - Visual analysis of our applications

  ![AWS XRAY](../images/AWS_XRay.PNG)

### AWS X-Ray advantages

- Troubleshooting performance (bottlenecks)
- Understand dependencies in a microservice architecture
- Pinpoint service issues
- Review request behavior
- Find errors and exceptions
- Are we meeting time SLA?
- Where I am throttled?
- Identify users that are impacted

## Amazon CodeGuru

- An ML-powered service for **automated code reviews** and **application performance recommendations**

  ![CODE GURU](../images/CodeGuru.PNG)

- Provides two functionalities
  - **CodeGuru Reviewer:** automated code reviews for static code analysis (development)
  - **CodeGuru Profiler:** visibility/recommendations about application performance during runtime (production)

### Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer

  ![CODEGURU REVIEWER](../images/CodeGuru_Reviewer.PNG)

- Identify critical issues, security vulnerabilities, and hard-to-find bugs
- Example: common coding best practices, resource leaks, security detection, input validation
- Uses Machine Learning and automated reasoning
- Hard-learned lessons across millions of code reviews on 1000s of open-source and Amazon repositories
- Supports Java and Python
- Integrates with GitHub, Bitbucket, and AWS CodeCommit

### Amazon CodeGuru Profiler

  ![CODEGURU PROFILER](../images/CodeGuru_Profiler.PNG)

- Helps understand the runtime behavior of your application
- Example: identify if your application is consuming excessive CPU capacity on a logging routine
- Features:
  - Identify and remove code inefficiencies
  - Improve application performance (e.g., reduce CPU utilization)
  - Decrease compute costs
  - Provides heap summary (identify which objects using up memory)
  - Anomaly Detection
- Support applications running on AWS or on-premise
- Minimal overhead on application

## AWS Health Dashboard - Service History

  ![AWS HEALTH DASHBOARD SERVICE HISTORY](../images/AWS_Health_Dashboard_Service_History.PNG)

- Shows all regions, all services health
- Shows historical information for each day
- Has an RSS feed you can subscribe to
- Previously called **AWS Service Health Dashboard**

## AWS Health Dashboard - Your Account

- Previously called **AWS Personal Health Dashboard (PHD)**
- AWS Account Health Dashboard provides **alerts and remediation guidance** when AWS is experiencing **events that may impact you**
- While the Service Health Dashboard displays the general status of AWS services, Account Health Dashboard gives you a **personalized view into the performance and availability of the AWS services underlying your AWS resources**
- The dashboard displays **relevant and timely information** to help you manage events in progress and provides **proactive notification** to help you plan for **scheduled activities**
- **Can aggregate data from an entire AWS Organization**
  
  ![AWS HEALTH DASHBOARD YOUR ACCOUNT](../images/AWS_Health_Dashboard_Your_Account.PNG)
