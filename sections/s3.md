## Introduction

- Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS
- It's advertised as "infinitely scaling" storage
- Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone
- Many AWS services use Amazon S3 for integrations as well

## S3 Use cases

- Backup and storage - for your files and for your disks
- Disaster Recovery - you will move your data to another region in case your region goes down 
- Archive - you can archive files in S3 and retrieve it at a later stage for much, much cheaper
- Hybrid Cloud storage - in case you have storage on-premises, but you want to expand it into the cloud
- Application hosting
- Media hosting - hosting video files, images and so on
- Data lakes & big data analytics - to store a lot of data and perform big data analytics
- Software delivery
- Static website

**Use Cases:** 
- NASDAQ stores 7 years of data into the S3 glacier which is the archival service in S3
- Sysco runs analytics on its data and gains business insights from Amazon S3

## Amazon S3 Overview - Buckets

- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)
- Buckets must have a **globally unique name (across all regions you have in your accounts, but also all the accounts that exist out there on AWS)**
- Buckets must be defined in a specific **region** even though the name of the bucket is unique across all regions and all the accounts
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- Naming convention
  - No uppercase
  - No underscore
  - 3-63 characters long
  - Not an IP
  - Must start with lowercase letter or number
  - Must NOT start with the prefix **xn--** since it is reserved for **internationalized domain names (IDNs)**
  - Must NOT end with the suffix **-s3alias** since it is reserved for **S3 Access Point aliases**

## Amazon S3 Overview - Objects

- Objects (files) have a Key
- Amazon S3 object **key** is the FULL path of your file:
  - s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt - Here **my-bucket** is the top level directory. Key of **my_file.txt** is **my_file.txt**
  - s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt - In case you want to nest it what we call folders, then the key of **my_file.txt** is **my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt**
- The key is composed of **prefix** + **object name**
  - s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt - **prefix** is **my_folder1/another_folder** and **object name** is **my_file.txt**
- There's no concept of "directories" within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
- Just keys with very long names that contain slashes ("/") and keys are made up of prefix and object name
- Object values are the content of the body:
  - Max Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
  - If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload" to upload that file into several parts. If you have a file of 5TB, then you must upload at least 1000 parts of 5GB each
- Metadata (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata)
- Tags (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
- Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

## Amazon S3 - Security

- **User based**
  - IAM policies - As a user ou can have IAM policies attached to you and the IAM policies will authorize which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console
- **Resource Based**
  - **Bucket Policies** - they are the most common way of to do security and we can assign bucket wide rules directly from the S3 console. This allow a specific user to come in or allow a user from another account to access your S3 buckets. This is how you can make your **S3 buckets public**
  - **Object Access Control List (ACL)** – they are finer grain security and they can be disabled
  - **Bucket Access Control List (ACL)** – they are way less common and they can be disabled
- **Note:** Below are the situations in which **an IAM principal can access an S3 object on the specified API call**:
  - if the IAM permissions ALLOW it OR if the resource policy ALLOWS it
  - AND there’s no explicit DENY in the action
- **Encryption:** another way of doing security on S3 buckets is to encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

## S3 Bucket Policies

- **JSON based policies**
  - Resources: specifies what buckets and objects this policy applies on. In the example, it applies to all the objects within the example bucket and this is what the star (*) is for
  - Effect: We allow / deny actions
  - Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny. In the example, the action we allow is GetObject to anyone since the Principal is star (*)
   Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
- Use S3 bucket for policy to:
  - Grant public access to the bucket
  - Force objects to be encrypted at upload
  - Grant access to another account (Cross Account)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "sid": "PublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3::examplebucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example: Public Access - Use Bucket Policy

- We have a user on the internet who wants to access our S3 buckets.
- We will attach an S3 bucket policy that allows public access then the user can access any objects within it.

  ![PUBLIC ACCESS BUCKET POLICY](../images/PublicAccess_UseBucketPolicy.PNG)

## Example: User Access to S3 - IAM permissions

- If you have an IAM user within your account and he wants to access S3 bucket, then we can assign IAM permissions to that user through a policy. Therefore because the policy allows access to the S3 buckets then the user can access our S3 buckets.

  ![USER ACCESS TO S3 IAM PERMISSIONS](../images/UserAccessToS3_IAMPermissions.PNG)

## Example: EC2 instance access - Use IAM Roles

- If you have an EC2 instance and want to give access from the EC2 instance into the S3 buckets, we have seen that IAM users are not appropriate, we need to use IAM roles instead.
- We create an EC2 instance role with the correct IAM permissions then EC2 instance will be able to access Amazon S3 buckets.

  ![EC2 INSTANCE ACCESS USE IAM ROLES](../images/EC2InstanceAccess_UseIAMRoles.PNG)

## Example: Advanced: Cross-Account Access - Use Bucket Policy

- More advanced, if you want to allow Cross-Account access, then you must use a bucket policy.
- We have an IAM user in another AWS account, we create an S3 bucket policy that allows Cross-Account access for that specific IAM user therefore the IAM user will be able to make API calls into our S3 buckets.

  ![ADVANCE CROSS ACCOUNT ACCESS](../images/Advanced_CrossAccountAccess_UseBucketPolicy.PNG)

## Example: Bucket Settings for Block Public Access

- Other security settings that you need to know about is that there is the bucket settings for Block Public Access
- We set the values to "On" when we created the buckets

  ![BUCKET SETTINGS FOR BLOCK PUBLIC ACCESS](../images/BucketSettings_BlockPublicAccess.PNG)

- These settings were invented by AWS as an extra layer of security to prevent company data leaks
- Even though you would set an S3 bucket policy that would make it public, if these settings are enabled, the bucket will never be public to prevent data leaks. If you know that your buckets should never be public then leave these settings on.
- If you know none of your S3 buckets should be public, then you can set this at the account level

## S3 - Static Website Hosting

- S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the internet
- The website URL depending on the AWS region where you create it will be either of these two:
  - **bucket-name.s3-website-aws-region.amazonaws.com**
  - **bucket-name.s3-website.aws-region.amazonaws.com**
- We have an S3 buckets containing files, maybe HTML files, maybe images, then we are going to enable this to be compatible with hosting a website.
- Then our users will try to access our S3 buckets it will not work as we do not have public reads enabled on our S3 buckets.
- **If you get a 403 (Forbidden) error, after enabling your S3 buckets for reads, then make sure to attach an S3 bucket policy that allows it to be public!**

## S3 - Versioning

- Once you have created a website, but it would be nicer to be able to update it in a safe way
- You can version your files in Amazon S3
- It is enabled at the **bucket level**.
- We have our bucket enabled with versioning and whenever a user uploads a file, it is going to create a version of that file at the selected key
- And then should we re-upload the same key and overwrite the file, it is going to increment the "version" from 1 to 2, 3, and so on

  ![S3 BUCKET VERSIONING](../images/S3Bucket_Versioning.PNG)

- Therefore it is a best practice to version your buckets because it would
  - protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version). For example, if you delete a file version, it just adds a delete marker and you can restore versions that were previously there instead 
  - be easy to roll back to previous version
- Notes:
  - Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”
  - Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions

## S3 Access Logs

- For audit purpose, you may want to log all access to S3 buckets
- Any request made to S3, from any account, authorized or denied, will be logged into another S3 bucket
- That data can be analyzed using data analysis tools…
- Very helpful to come down to the root cause of an issue, or audit usage, view suspicious patterns, etc…

## S3 Replication (CRR & SRR)

- Must enable versioning in source and destination
- Cross Region Replication (CRR)
- Same Region Replication (SRR)
- Buckets can be in different accounts
- Copying is asynchronous
- Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
- CRR - Use cases: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
- SRR – Use cases: log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts

## S3 Storage Classes

- [Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose](#s3-standard-general-purpose)
- [Amazon S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (IA)](#s3-standard-infrequent-access-s3-standard-ia)
- [Amazon S3 One Zone - Infrequent Access](#s3-one-zone-infrequent-access-s3-one-zone-ia)

### S3 Durability and Availability

- Durability:
  - High durability (99.999999999%, 11 9’s) of objects across multiple AZ
  - If you store 10,000,000 objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years
  - Same for all storage classes
- Availability:
  - Measures how readily available a service is
  - Varies depending on storage class
  - Example: S3 standard has 99.99% availability = not available 53 minutes a year

### S3 Standard - General Purpose

- 99.99% Availability
- Used for frequently accessed data
- Low latency and high throughput
- Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures
- Use Cases: Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution…

### S3 Storage Classes - Infrequent Access

- For data that is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed
- Lower cost than S3 Standard

#### S3 Standard Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)

- 99.9% Availability

## S3 Object Lock & Glacier Vault Lock

- S3 Object Lock
  - Adopt a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model
  - Block an object version deletion for a specified amount of time
- Glacier Vault Lock
  - Adopt a WORM (Write Once Read Many) model
  - Lock the policy for future edits (can no longer be changed)
  - Helpful for compliance and data retention

## Shared Responsibility Model for S3

| AWS | YOU |
| --- | --- |
| Infrastructure (global security, durability, availability, sustain concurrent loss of data in two facilities) | S3 Versioning, S3 Bucket Policies, S3 Replication Setup |
| Configuration and vulnerability analysis | Logging and Monitoring, S3 Storage Classes |
| Compliance validation | Data encryption at rest and in transit |

## AWS Snow Family

- Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge, and migrate data into and out of AWS
- Data migration:
  - Snowcone
  - Snowball Edge
  - Snowmobile
- Edge computing:
  - Snowcone
  - Snowball Edge

### Data Migrations with AWS Snow Family

- **AWS Snow Family: offline devices to perform data migrations** If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices!

- Challenges:
  - Limited connectivity
  - Limited bandwidth
  - High network cost
  - Shared bandwidth (can’t maximize the line)
  - Connection stability

### Time to Transfer

| Data   | 100 Mbps | 1Gbps    | 10Gbps   |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 10 TB  | 12 days  | 30 hours | 3 hours  |
| 100 TB | 124 days | 12 days  | 30 hours |
| 1 PB   | 3 years  | 124 days | 12 days  |

### Snowball Edge (for data transfers)

- Physical data transport solution: move TBs or PBs of data in or out of AWS
- Alternative to moving data over the network (and paying network fees)
- Pay per data transfer job
- Provide block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage
- Snowball Edge Storage Optimized
  - 80 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
- Snowball Edge Compute Optimized
  - 42 TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
- Use cases: large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster recovery

### AWS Snowcone

- Small, portable computing, anywhere, rugged & secure, withstands harsh environments
- Light (4.5 pounds, 2.1 kg)
- Device used for edge computing, storage, and data transfer
- **8 TBs of usable storage**
- Use Snowcone where Snowball does not fit (space-constrained environment)
- Must provide your own battery / cables
- Can be sent back to AWS offline, or connect it to internet and use **AWS DataSync** to send data

### AWS Snowmobile

- Transfer exabytes of data (1 EB = 1,000 PB = 1,000,000 TBs)
- Each Snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity (use multiple in parallel)
- High security: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video surveillance
- **Better than Snowball if you transfer more than 10 PB**

| Properties       | Snowcone                        | Snowball Edge Storage Optimized | Snowmobile              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Storage Capacity | 8 TB usable                     | 80 TB usable                    | < 100 PB                |
| Migration Size   | Up to 24 TB, online and offline | Up to petabytes, offline        | Up to exabytes, offline |

### Snow Family - Usage Process

1. Request Snowball devices from the AWS console for delivery
2. Install the snowball client / AWS OpsHub on your servers
3. Connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client
4. Ship back the device when you’re done (goes to the right AWS facility)
5. Data will be loaded into an S3 bucket
6. Snowball is completely wiped

## What is Edge Computing?

- Process data while it’s being created on an edge location
  - A truck on the road, a ship on the sea, a mining station underground...
- These locations may have
  - Limited / no internet access
  - Limited / no easy access to computing power
- We setup a **Snowball Edge / Snowcone** device to do edge computing
- Use cases of Edge Computing:
  - Preprocess data
  - Machine learning at the edge
  - Transcoding media streams
- Eventually (if need be) we can ship back the device to AWS (for transferring data for example)

## Snow Family - Edge Computing

- **Snowcone (smaller)**
  - 2 CPUs, 4 GB of memory, wired or wireless access
  - USB-C power using a cord or the optional battery
- **Snowball Edge – Compute Optimized**
  - 52 vCPUs, 208 GiB of RAM
  - Optional GPU (useful for video processing or machine learning)
  - 42 TB usable storage
- **Snowball Edge – Storage Optimized**
  - Up to 40 vCPUs, 80 GiB of RAM
  - Object storage clustering available
- All: Can run EC2 Instances & AWS Lambda functions (using AWS IoT Greengrass)
- Long-term deployment options: 1 and 3 years discounted pricing

## AWS OpsHub

- Historically, to use Snow Family devices, you needed a CLI (Command Line Interface tool)
- Today, you can use **AWS OpsHub** (a software you install on your computer / laptop) to manage your Snow Family Device
  - Unlocking and configuring single or clustered devices
  - Transferring files
  - Launching and managing instances running on Snow Family Devices
  - Monitor device metrics (storage capacity, active instances on your device)
  - Launch compatible AWS services on your devices (ex: Amazon EC2 instances, AWS DataSync, Network File System (NFS))

## Hybrid Cloud for Storage

- AWS is pushing for ”hybrid cloud”
  - Part of your infrastructure is on-premises
  - Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
- This can be due to
  - Long cloud migrations
  - Security requirements
  - Compliance requirements
  - IT strategy
- S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS / NFS), so how do you expose the S3 data on-premise?
- AWS Storage Gateway!

## AWS Storage Gateway

- Bridge between on-premise data and cloud data in S3
- Hybrid storage service to allow on- premises to seamlessly use the AWS Cloud
- Use cases: disaster recovery, backup & restore, tiered storage
- Types of Storage Gateway:
  - File Gateway
  - Volume Gateway
  - Tape Gateway
- No need to know the types at the exam

## Amazon S3 - Summary
